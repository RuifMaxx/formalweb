# 👨‍🎓 About Me

I’m a post-graduate student at Automation School, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), and received B.Eng. degree in Automation & Control, Shandong University (SDU). As a member of the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex Systems, I’m supervised by Prof. [Yuanqing Xia](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=HtedN3oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Assistant Prof. [Yufeng Zhan](https://ray-zhan.github.io/). I am active on [![Zhihu](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Zhihu-333333?style=flat&logo=Zhihu&logoColor=FFFFFF&color=0084FF)](https://www.zhihu.com/people/peak-81) & [![Bilibili](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bilibili-333333?style=flat&logo=Bilibili&logoColor=FFFFFF&color=FF69B4)](https://space.bilibili.com/269154813?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0) & [![Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-333333?style=flat&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&color=000000)](https://github.com/RuifMaxx) to share my *Blogs & Life & Codes*. ***I love to make friends. So if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you more!***

My research interests include cloud resource management and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), which aims to take machine learning models to production, and then maintain and monitor them. 

# 🏷 Projects

**Sep. 2022 - Jun. 2023: Intelligent Scrap Steel Grading System(Participate) Supported by the [China Unicom](http://www.chinaunicom.com.cn/index.html)** 

- Responsible for Building a Machine Learning Operations System on a Serverless Platform.

**Nov. 2020 - Jun. 2021: Multi-dimensional Time Series prediction based on Deep Learning.** Undergraduate research project thesis. Earned 119 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/RuifMaxx/Multidimensional-time-series-with-transformer). Achieved grade A. 

- Learned Generative Models (VAE, FLOW, GAN). Identified the disadvantages of existing models in modeling long sequences. I replaced the decoder of TPA model with GRU to build GRU-TPA model and combined the advantages of MQ-RNN and self-attention to build the MQ-Attention model.

**Sonnet:** A Control-Theoretic Approach for Resource Allocation in Cluster Management

**Ruifeng Ma,** Yufeng Zhan, Chuge Wu, Zehua Guo and Yuanqing Xia

- Existing methods cannot describe the internal mathematical expression between resources and performance, resulting in the inability to accurately give the amount of resource allocation under dynamic load conditions.
- We use a dynamic linearization approach to identify a model between resources and performance and minimize an objective function that controls error and resource cost.
